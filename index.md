| 0 | General Setup | [Link](https://github.com/Soham360/APCSA/issues/1) | This week we set up/updated the tools needed for this trimester. We also created a new github page instead of a fastpage because fastpages is now deprecated. I also added a theme to my github page. I wanted to make a custom theme but that requires a lot of css and causes a lot of formatting issues. I also added a typing game that gives you 5 words to type and you have to type them as fast as you can. |
