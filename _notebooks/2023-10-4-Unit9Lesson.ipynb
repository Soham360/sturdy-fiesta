    "## 9.3 Overriding Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This enables a subclass to provide its own behavior for a method while maintaining a relationship with its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context Java, here's how method overriding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Method overriding is closely related to inheritance. You have a superclass (or base class) and a subclass (or derived class). The subclass inherits properties and behaviors from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Superclass Method: The superclass defines a method. This method can be overridden by the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclass Overrides: In the subclass, you can provide a new implementation of the same method. This is done by using the same method name, return type, and parameter list.\n",
    "\n",
    "@Override Annotation (Java): In Java, it's common to use the @Override annotation to explicitly indicate that a method in the subclass is intended to override a method in the superclass. This helps catch errors during compilation if the method doesn't correctly match the superclass method signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Override Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding is used for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customization: It allows you to customize or extend the behavior of a superclass method in the subclass to meet the specific needs of the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Method overriding is a key component of polymorphism. It enables you to treat objects of the subclass as if they were objects of the superclass, promoting flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: Method overriding helps maintain a consistent interface for classes in an inheritance hierarchy. Code that uses the superclass doesn't need to be changed when a subclass overrides a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: It promotes code reusability by allowing you to build on existing code in the superclass."
